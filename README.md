# PyBer Analysis

## Overview 
The purpose of this project is to first create a summary DataFrame by city type of the ride-sharing data given in supplied csv files (city_data.csv and ride_data.csv). Then using Pandas and Matplotlib create a multiple-line graph that illustrates to stakeholders the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results
The analysis shows that the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types are:

* Rural areas have the lowest amount of *Total Rides*, *Total Dirvers* and *Total Fares*. However, rural areas have the highest *Average Fare per Ride* and *Average Fare per         Driver*. 

* Suburban areas hold a middle point in the data. The data for *Total Rides*, *Total Dirvers*, *Total Fares*, *Average Fare per Ride* and *Average Fare per Driver* are               consistantly in between the same data points for Rural and Urban.         

* Urban areas show the highest amount of *Total Rides*, *Total Dirvers* and *Total Fares*. However, urban areas have the lowest *Average Fare     per Ride* and *Average Fare per     Driver*.
