# PyBer Analysis

## Overview 
The purpose of this project is to first create a summary DataFrame by city type of the ride-sharing data given in supplied csv files (city_data.csv and ride_data.csv). Then using Pandas and Matplotlib create a multiple-line graph that illustrates to stakeholders the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results
The analysis shows that the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types are:

* Rural areas have the lowest amount of *Total Rides*, *Total Dirvers* and *Total Fares*. However, rural areas have the highest *Average Fare per Ride* and *Average Fare per         Driver*. 

* Suburban areas hold a middle point in the data. The data for *Total Rides*, *Total Dirvers*, *Total Fares*, *Average Fare per Ride* and *Average Fare per Driver* are               consistantly in between the same data points for Rural and Urban.         

* Urban areas show the highest amount of *Total Rides*, *Total Dirvers* and *Total Fares*. However, urban areas have the lowest *Average Fare     per Ride* and *Average Fare per     Driver*.

## Summary
Although the the graph below shows that regardless of city type the fares are fairly consistant with peaks at the end of February 2019  and and dips in March 2019 there are a few recommendations to address disparities among the city types.

### Recommendations
1. Charge more per mile in Urban areas to offset the driver's average fare. 
2. Create discount offers for longer trip fares to offset Rural drivers average fare.  
3. Further analysis of average trip length and average trip milage in Rural, Suburban and Urban areas to create designated flat-rate fare zones.
